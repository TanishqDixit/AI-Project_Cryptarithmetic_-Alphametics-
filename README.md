“Cryptarithmetic Puzzle Using Backtracking Algorithm &amp; Using Brute-force search (Exhaustive search) Algorithm”
Cryptarithmetic, also known as alphametics, is a type of mathematical game (or puzzle) consisting of a mathematical equation among unknown numbers, whose digits are represented by letters of the alphabet. The goal is to identify the value of each letter. Solving a cryptarithm by hand usually involves a mix of deductions and exhaustive tests of possibilities. To eliminate this human effort/problem, I have used backtracking paradigm of algorithm design. I have also considered using brute-force method, and algorithms that generate all permutations of m choices from n possibilities.
